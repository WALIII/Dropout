%CaImSegmentation.m
%   See Pnevmatikakis & Paninski, 2014 & 2016, for their matrix factorization
%     algorithm to automate image segmentation for calcium imaging data.
%     Briefly, if d is the total number of pixels in an image, T is the number
%     of time steps in a video, and K is the maximum number of neurons, then
%     the observed fluorescence signal Y (matrix size d-by-T) can be
%     regarded as a noisy function of the true signal,F, by Y = F + E, where E is
%     Gaussian noise.  F, in turn, can be regarded as a signal of the form
%     F = AC+B, where A is a d-by-K matrix representing the spatial footprint
%     of neuron k, C is a K-by-T matrix representing the calcium activity of
%     the k-th neuron, and B is a d-by-T matrix representing the background
%     fluorescence at each pixel.  The algorithm infers the matrices
%     A and C from the observed fluorescence signal Y using matrix factorization
%     and convex optimization based on several assumptions:
%       1) the difference between F = AC+B and Y will be the noise E, thus
%        constraining the following steps to find values for A, C, and B
%        that force abs(Y-F) < noise ... they make an estimate of the noise
%        as a first step in the algorithm
%       2) each neuron will be small relative to the size of the original
%        image, of approximate size based on the input estNeuronSize, so
%        the matrix A should be sparse
%       3) the calcium signal, C, for each neuron will be an AR(p) process
%        of the following form, for an individual neuron,
%          c(t) = SUM [j=1 to p] gamma-p*c(t-j) + s(t), where s(t) is the
%          number of actual spikes at time t
%
%  This code must be run after downloading ca_source_extraction-master
%   from the GitHub repository created for the papers referenced above -
%   Go to: https://github.com/epnev/ca_source_extraction.git
%  You also need CVX placed in your MATLAB directory - http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/
%
%INPUT: VideoFileName - file name of the video to be segmented as a string,
%          'Video.tif'
%       maxNeurons - maximum neurons in the video, this is an estimate that
%        constrains the maximum number of neurons, this value will affect
%        the number of neurons found by the algorithm
%       estNeuronSize - estimate of the average neuron diameter in pixels
%       AR_p - order of the autoregressive process of the calcium dynamics
%        ... this will depend on the sampling frequency and thus needs to
%        be inferred before running the script, a simple check would be to
%        look at the trace from a single pixel with a known neuron and then
%        to look at the rise and decay time for a spike ... if the spike
%        rises and falls in 4 time steps, then that's probably an AR(4)
%        process
%       maxITER -  number of iterations to perform (update spatial, update
%        temporal, merge, repeat)
%
%OUTPUT: SpatMap - d-by-K matrix representing the spatial map for the
%         k-th neuron
%         To view the maps, run the following code:
%          % if d = width*height, in pixels
%          myMap = zeros(width,height,K);
%          for ii=1:K
%             myMap(:,:,ii) = reshape(SpatMap(:,ii),[width,height]);
%          end
%          % make figure with a representative example
%          figure();imagesc(squeeze(myMap(:,:,1)));colormap jet;
%
%        CaSignal - a K-by-T matrix representing the inferred calcium
%         signal for the k-th neuron across all time steps, dF/F
%        width - width of original image in pixels
%        height - height of original image in pixels
%
% If you are unsure of the neuron size input, you must be very cautious because
% the initialization procedure is heavily dependent on that value.  Check
% greedyROI2d.m for that procedure, specifically look to imblur()
